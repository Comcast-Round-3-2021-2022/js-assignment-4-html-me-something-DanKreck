               <h3>The Situation</h3>
               <p>
                  Years back, when technicians were tasked with logging their inventory, the procedure was very new. 
                  Supervisors were scanning our inventory one vehicle at a time. This obviously wasnt productive, 
                  and was causing a potential for missed appointments and a poor customer experience. 
               </p>
               <h3>The Task</h3>
               <p>
                  Having some background with Android applications, I decided I was going to attempt to make an iPhone 
                  application that solved this issue. After a few weeks of research and a lot of trial and error, I 
                  was able to compile a working application that offered a solution. 
               </p>
               <h3>The Action</h3>
               <p>
                  I named the application "VanScan". I installed the app onto my phone, and began testing the workflow
                  with other employees in the reconciliation department. I asked them what issues they were facing and 
                  what this application might be able to do to assist them. After a few suggestions, I added two features:
               </p>
               <ol>
                  <li>Providing the NT Login username in the file name.</li>
                  <li>Exporting the inventory results as an Excel file.</li>
                  
               </ol>
               <h3>The Result</h3>
               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
                  VanScan proved to be very effective and saved me a lot of time in my role as a technician. The app caught the 
                  attention of a national director, and we discussed the possibility of having VanScan uploaded to the internal 
                  app catalog. I continued to use VanScan for a few months, until Comcast offered a 3rd party solution. 
                  The new solution offered more options such as the ability to receive, lookup status, etc. Because of this, my 
                  app was essentially obsolete. However, I have already found areas of improvement in the current process, and I 
                  believe we could offer a better solution within Tech360, that would render the current process obsolete.
